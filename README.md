qt-straightalpha
================

Sometimes H.264 files in MP4 containers play significantly darker when viewed using Quicktime (or Safari's HTML5 <video> tag which uses Quicktime) on a Windows PC. One reason for this is that Quicktime poorly handles pixel data with alpha information by default.
qt-straightalpha will patch an MP4 file to tell quicktime to use the "Straight Alpha" graphics mode by altering the [vmhd](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFChap2/qtff2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000939-CH204-33012) atom.

If you are seeing much darker videos in safari than in other browsers or if areas of white are showing as grey in Quicktime then give this script a go.

This is *not* the same as altering the [colr](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Fquicktime%2Ficefloe%2Fdispatch019.html%23colr) atom as handbrake once did to trigger a change in gamma handling.


Requirements
------------

You'll just need to have Ruby installed. 
Untested on Windows but it should work.


Usage
-----

ruby ./qt-straightalpha movie.mp4

Your movie will be patched in place to save rewriting the whole file, so it's recommended that you operate on a copy it is important.
